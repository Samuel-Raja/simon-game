    <h1>Rules of Simon Game</h1>
    <h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Press the Start button to begin the game</li>
        <li>At the start, Simon will randomly give you a signal ( one color will pop up).</li>
        <li>You have to repeat the signal by pressing the same color. </li>
        <li>Simon will duplicate the first signal and add a random one. </li>
        <li>You need to repeat these two signals by pressing the same color lenses, in the order.</li>
        <li>Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.</li>
        <li>You need to repeat these three signals in the order.</li>
        <li>Simon will repeat all three signals and add one.</li>
        <li>Continue playing as long as you can repeat the sequence.</li>
        <li>If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, Simon responds with a "REZZ" sound.  That means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends. GAME OVER.</li>
      </ol>
